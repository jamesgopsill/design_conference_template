# Unofficial LaTeX template for the DESIGN conference

This git repo contains a LaTeX template that faithfully recreates the word template used by the [DESIGN conference](https://www.designconference.org/).

## Usage

The template is intended for individuals who like to use LaTeX while drafting their documents. **N.b.** The conference requires the final submission to be in word so you will have to copy and paste the content over when the time comes.

The template uses LuaLaTeX to compile the PDF and has been developed and tested using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/). 

`main.tex` is the entrypoint for your LaTeX document.

`instructions_for_authors.tex` is a recreation of the instructions_for_authors.docx file provided by the DESIGN conference. This has been used to confirm that the template conforms to the word template.

**Happy LaTeXing and good luck with your paper!**
